# DataStructures_BplusTree
The project revolves around implementation of B+Tree for storing the Key,Value pair. The challenge of B+Tree is to sustain its required degree at each node.

The project is focused on four basic functionalities:

(1) Degree Initialization : initialize degree 'm' of B+Tree.
(2) Insert Key Value Pair : When insert() function is called up, KeyValue pair will be inserted at desired place.
(3) Search Key : When search() function is called up, value associated with a particular key is displayed as output.
(4) Range Search : In this case, user searches for a particular range of key values as (Key1, Key2). The expected output is all Key Value     pairs within this range such that Key1<=Key<=Key2.
